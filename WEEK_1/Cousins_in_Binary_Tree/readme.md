# Problem-Cousins In Binary Tree

In a binary tree, the root node is at depth `0`, and children of each depth `k` node are at depth `k+1`.

Two nodes of a binary tree are cousins if they have the same depth, but have different parents.

We are given the `root` of a binary tree with unique values, and the values `x` and `y` of two different nodes in the tree.

Return `true` if and only if the nodes corresponding to the values `x` and `y` are cousins.

### Example 1:

![](https://assets.leetcode.com/uploads/2019/02/12/q1248-01.png)

```
Input: root = [1,2,3,4], x = 4, y = 3
Output: false
```
### Example 2:

![](https://assets.leetcode.com/uploads/2019/02/12/q1248-02.png)

```
Input: root = [1,2,3,null,4], x = 2, y = 3
Output: false
```

### Note:

- The number of nodes in the tree will be between `2` and `100`.
- Each node has a unique integer value from `1` to `100`.
